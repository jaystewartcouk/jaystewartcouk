</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>At the end of 2011, I arrived back in Bristol after 15 months of travel around Asia. I was 26 years old and felt like I was starting my life from scratch. I had a good sit down with myself and contemplated the style of life I was longing for. I wanted to earn a decent keep and have flexibility with my time and location. I wanted a challenge.</p>
<p>My best friend at the time, Thomas Buckley-Houston, was a programmer. I had always been fascinated with computers since the age of 15 but I had never tried delving into actually writing code. Tom gave me my first coding lesson in the PHP framework WordPress.</p>
<p>I had no money and was living with my mother. I needed to both find a place to live and an income fast. I found a part-time job cleaning offices in a business center. I spent my free time scouring the web for free coding tutorials. I also worked with Tom to build a simple frontend <a href="https://github.com/jaystewartcouk/dharmasearch">Dharmasearch</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/tombh/dharma-api">Dharma API</a> which aimed to be the single canonical source of all the Dharma talks and teachers on the web.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2021, after a few months of working and studying, I got friendly with a few of the offices I was cleaning. The thriving <a href="https://c3.agency/">C3</a> digital agency was particularly helpful and gave me a mock interview to prepare me for my first junior developer applications. Shortly afterward they reported that I interviewed better than the other experienced candidates and gave me a job. For the next two years, I worked with the Magento e-commerce framework written in PHP.</p>
<p>In 2014 I received a message from <a href="https://www.wearefolk.com/">We Are Folk</a> who had found me on the list of Magento-certified developers. They offered me a very rosy deal with the promise of sunny seaside living in Bournemouth and couldn't say no. I was also working with Magento at We Are Folk but it was different. There was a huge emphasis on learning and utilizing new tools and processes. At one time my team leader reported I was of the most productive developers and this fueled my fire for more. I worked at We Are Folk for two years.</p>
<p>In 2016, after working at two digital agencies I made the move to go freelance. At the time I was going to a chiropractor called Krishan for treatments. He had been struggling to find a booking system that fitted his requirement. I won the job to create a customized booking system for which I learned and utilized the Laravel PHP web framework. It was without a doubt the most satisfying project in my career which I launched and worked on over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>In 2018 I was contracted by <a href="https://goramandvincent.com/">Goram &amp; Vincent</a>. They were launching Dyson e-commerce websites internationally and required an experienced Magento developer. This was the peak of my career and I was earning the most I ever had.</p>
<p>In 2020 Goram &amp; Vincent decided to move away from contractors shortly after COVID hit. I had a good chunk of money in my bank and life seemed to be calling for a different kind of adventure. Over the next two years, I followed a path of spiritual and personal development. I lived in two communities in England and Sweden. Then I flew to Mexico in search of new adventures, experiences, and abundance.</p>
<p>As I write this post in 2023 I have a burning calling to innovate once again. I have found new inspiration in the world of startups and picked up my coding skills from where I left off after COVID. I am recharged, reinspired, and ready to go! Watch this space.</p>
